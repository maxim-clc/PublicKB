## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

<p><strong>Q: How will I connect to my MySQL instance?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: You will instantly receive your connection string information when you create your database subscription.  Use the provided connection string and your selected credentials to connect to and manage your database using your favorite MySQL Client.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How is my data isolated from other Database-as-a-Service tenants?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Each MySQL instance lives on it's own Virtual Machine.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I choose to replicate my data for higher availability?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The initial DBaaS beta does not include replication options, so is better suited for POCs and Test/Dev environments.  Future releases will include replication options.  To stay up to date on feature releases, sign up for our Early Adopter Program.  In doing so, you will receive monthly updates on new features released and will be informed when replication options are available.
</p>
<p><strong>Q: I understand that SSL Encryption options are available.  Will my data be encrypted in transit and/or at rest? </strong>
</p>
<p>A: Upon database subscription, you will be given the option to download a self-signed cert that can be consumed by your target application. When implemented, your database connection is encrypted as well as your data in transit.  Please see the KB article on [Connecting to MySQL DBaas Over SSL](../Database/connecting-to-mysql-dbaas-over-ssl.md) for additional details.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Q: I understand that CenturyLink is backing my data up daily.  How can I access my backups in order to restore? </strong>
</p>
<p>A: During our initial beta, you can send a request to <a href="mailto:dbaas-support@ctl.io">dbaas-support@ctl.io</a> to request a restore from backup and we will work with you to restore your data.</p>
